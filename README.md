# Bounding-Boxes
1.Bounding Box Implementation with Tesseract OCR
This notebook demonstrates how to use Tesseract OCR along with OpenCV to implement bounding boxes around individual characters in an image. The bounding boxes are drawn to highlight characters detected in an image, which is useful in applications like document analysis, text recognition, and image preprocessing for machine learning.

2.YOLO Object Detection Project
This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model in a Colab environment. YOLO is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that is widely used for detecting objects in images and videos.

3.Easy-OCR
This project leverages the EasyOCR library to detect text from scanned images and draws bounding boxes around the detected text areas.

## Key Features
OCR Processing: The script uses the EasyOCR library to extract text from scanned images.
Bounding Boxes: It identifies the position of the text in the images, drawing bounding boxes around detected words.
Text Extraction: Outputs the recognized text in a structured format.
