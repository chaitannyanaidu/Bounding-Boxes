# Bounding-Boxes
Bounding Box Implementation with Tesseract OCR
This notebook demonstrates how to use Tesseract OCR along with OpenCV to implement bounding boxes around individual characters in an image. The bounding boxes are drawn to highlight characters detected in an image, which is useful in applications like document analysis, text recognition, and image preprocessing for machine learning.
