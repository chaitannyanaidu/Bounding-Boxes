# Bounding-Boxes
1.Bounding Box Implementation with Tesseract OCR
This notebook demonstrates how to use Tesseract OCR along with OpenCV to implement bounding boxes around individual characters in an image. The bounding boxes are drawn to highlight characters detected in an image, which is useful in applications like document analysis, text recognition, and image preprocessing for machine learning.

2.YOLO Object Detection Project
This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model in a Colab environment. YOLO is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that is widely used for detecting objects in images and videos.
